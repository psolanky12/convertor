Converter 

To learn and practice my HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills, I created a converter that converts temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit, weight from kg to pounds, and distance from km to miles. I added a navigation bar hyperlinked to the section and a home button that takes the user to the top of the page.
